# Intelligent-product-prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-learning-algorithms
This project targets on product recommendations for new users. This is attained by using Logistic regression to predict products precisely. Logistic regression is used for predicting binary class and computes the probability of an event occurrence. When the new user visit the application, he views products that has frequent purchase and high rating. Thus, the application is beneficial for customers and helps in decision making.
